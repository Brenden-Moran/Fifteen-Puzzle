# Fifteen-Puzzle
An interactive fifteen puzzle created in Python.

The game file creates an already shuffled fifteen puzzle where you can interact with it by typing in the number tile you would like to move.

The fifteen file creates a non-shuffled fifteen puzzle which has a shuffle button, where you can interact with the puzzle by clicking on the tiles with your mouse.

Overview:
The Interactive Fifteen Puzzle Game is a Python program developed using the Tkinter library, providing users with a dynamic and engaging digital version of the classic fifteen puzzle. The program offers a visually appealing interface where users can manipulate the puzzle tiles using on-screen buttons. Key features include the ability to shuffle the puzzle at any time, creating a challenging and interactive gameplay experience.

Key Features:

Tkinter GUI Interface:
The program utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays the fifteen puzzle. The GUI features interactive buttons, providing users with a convenient means of moving and shuffling the puzzle tiles.

Interactive Puzzle Tiles:
Puzzle tiles are represented on the GUI as clickable buttons. Users can interact with the puzzle by clicking on the tile they wish to move, simulating the sliding movement of tiles in a physical fifteen puzzle.

Shuffling Functionality:
The program allows users to shuffle the puzzle at any time, introducing an element of randomness and challenge. This feature adds replay value and ensures a different starting configuration for each gameplay session.

User Input Handling:
The program efficiently handles user input, validating and executing moves in response to button clicks. The interactive nature of the GUI enhances user engagement and provides a seamless gaming experience.

Dynamic Display Updates:
As users make moves, the program dynamically updates the display to reflect the new configuration of the puzzle. This real-time feedback ensures that users can track their progress and strategize their next moves.

User-Initiated Puzzle Solving:
The primary objective of the game is for users to solve the puzzle by arranging the tiles in the correct order. The interactive nature of the program empowers users to think critically and strategize their moves to achieve the goal.

Technical Details:

Programming Language: The program is written in Python, leveraging the Tkinter library for GUI development.
Event-Driven Programming: The program follows an event-driven paradigm, responding to user actions such as button clicks to update the puzzle state.
Randomization Algorithm: The shuffling functionality employs a randomization algorithm to create diverse starting configurations for the puzzle.
