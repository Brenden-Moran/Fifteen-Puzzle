# Fifteen-Puzzle
An interactive fifteen puzzle created in Python.

The game file creates an already shuffled fifteen puzzle where you can interact with it by typing in the number tile you would like to move.

The fifteen file creates a non-shuffled fifteen puzzle which has a shuffle button, where you can interact with the puzzle by clicking on the tiles with your mouse.
